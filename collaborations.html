			<h1>Rich Brian-Introvert(ft. Joji)</h1> 
			<p> This track was on the album Amen by Rich Brian. He and joji are very good friends and work for the same company. Joji plays the opening and his tone is so melodic and calming, with Brian coming in with the raps making it tune in together well.</p>

			<h1> Ryan Hemsworth-Think About U(ft. Joji)</h1> 
			<p> Ryan Hemsworth is a producer from canada and he is one of my favorites. He makes very soothing sounds and its very comfortable to listen to when your tired or bored. His sounds and Joji's voice combine very well and they made the track "Think About U" together.</p>

			<h1> 88Rising-MidSummer Madness</h1> 
			<p> 88Rising is the company that many artists work for. This song includes artists such as Rich Brian, Joji, Higher Brothers, and AUGUST 08. The combination of chinese hip hop and american R&B is really good and I believe that their music will only become better in the future.</p>

			<h1> 88Rising-La Cienega</h1> 
			<p> This track is sung by Niki and Joji. They're voices are both calming and bring a good vibe. This is one of my favorite songs from the album Head in the Clouds. The album is a collaborations of many artists that range from people who work with 88rising and others who dont. </p>
